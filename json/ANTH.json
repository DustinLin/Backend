        "description": "This course, intended for first-year anthropology graduate students, examines the contemporary practice of anthropology. We discuss the construction of a multiple-year research project including how to differentiate theory and evidence, the contours of anthropological interest, the question of audience, and rhetorical style.

        "description": "This course builds upon the question can authentic anthropology emerge from the critical intellectual traditions and counter-hegemonic struggles of Third World peoples? (Harrison 1991:1). We will analyze the rise of postcolonial and decolonial approaches across the four fields of the discipline over the past decade. In turn, we will analyze the ways a lack of attention to decolonial anthropology functions to reiterate hierarchies and oppressive systems of knowledge production. "
